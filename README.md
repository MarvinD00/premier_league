Installation

Install the package via pip:

pip install premier_league

Or install from source:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/premier_league.git
cd premier_league
pip install -e .

Quick Start
Importing the Package

The package provides several modules which can be imported directly:

from premier_league import (
    RankingTable,
    PlayerSeasonLeaders,
    Transfers,
    PLPredictor,
    run_server,
)

Using the RankingTable

Retrieve and export the league standings:

# Initialize for the 2023-2024 season
ranking = RankingTable(target_season="2023-2024")

# Get the current ranking list (list of lists)
ranking_data = ranking.get_ranking_list()
print(ranking_data)

# Export ranking table to CSV
ranking.get_ranking_csv("premier_league_standings", header="Premier League 2023-2024")

# Export ranking table to JSON
ranking.get_ranking_json("premier_league_standings", header="Premier League 2023-2024")

# Export ranking table to PDF
ranking.get_ranking_pdf("premier_league_standings")

Using the PlayerSeasonLeaders

Retrieve and export top goal scorers or assist leaders:

# For top goal scorers:
scorers = PlayerSeasonLeaders(stat_type="G", target_season="2023-2024")
top_scorers = scorers.get_top_stats_list(limit=10)
print(top_scorers)

# Export goal scorers data to CSV
scorers.get_top_stats_csv("top_goal_scorers", header="Top Goalscorers 2023-2024", limit=10)

# Export goal scorers data to JSON
scorers.get_top_stats_json("top_goal_scorers", header="Top Goalscorers 2023-2024", limit=10)

# Export goal scorers data to PDF (top 20 by default)
scorers.get_top_stats_pdf("top_goal_scorers", path="files")

Using the Transfers Module

Extract transfer data for a specific team:

# Initialize Transfers for a given season (optional)
transfers = Transfers(target_season="2023-2024")

# List all teams available in the season
teams = transfers.get_all_current_teams()
print("Teams:", teams)

# Print transfer table for a specific team (e.g., Arsenal)
transfers.print_transfer_table("Arsenal")

# Alternatively, export transfer data to CSV:
transfers.transfer_csv("Arsenal", "arsenal_transfers", transfer_type="both")

# Or export transfer data to JSON:
transfers.transfer_json("Arsenal", "arsenal_transfers", transfer_type="both")

Using the PLPredictor

Update your dataset and export it for further analysis or machine learning:

# Initialize the PLPredictor
predictor = PLPredictor()

# Update the dataset with new match data
predictor.update_data_set()

# Create a CSV dataset for analysis or training
predictor.create_dataset("ml_dataset.csv")

Running the API Server

Run a Flask-based API server (useful for development or deployment):

from premier_league import run_server

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Run the API on localhost at port 5000 with debug mode enabled
    run_server(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000, debug=True)

The API provides endpoints for:

    Player Stats (goals/assists) with file export options.
    League Standings with export to CSV/JSON/PDF.
    Transfers Data with options to filter incoming/outgoing transfers.

For more details on the API endpoints, please refer to the API Documentation section.
API Endpoints

The package includes a Flask API as well as AWS Lambda handlers. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

    /players/goals & /players/assists: Retrieve top player stats in JSON.
    /players/goals/csv_file & /players/assists/csv_file: Export player stats as CSV.
    /players/goals/json_file & /players/assists/json_file: Export player stats as JSON.
